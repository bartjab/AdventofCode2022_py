# AdventofCode2022_py
Advent of Code 2022 version tasks completed via Python 3.9

This is my approach of solving AoC tasks. I've tried to make code more flexible for other inputs than mine. Feel free to check if it's correct for different data and leave some suggestions for optimizing the code or let me know if there are any issues here.
